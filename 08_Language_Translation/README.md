# Language Translation (English to Hindi) using Seq2Seq Model

This project demonstrates how to build a sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) model for translating English sentences to Hindi using deep learning (LSTM). It covers data cleaning, vocabulary building, model training, and inference.

## Features

- Loads and cleans a parallel Hindi-English corpus
- Builds vocabularies and token indices for both languages
- Prepares data for training and testing
- Implements a seq2seq model with LSTM layers for translation
- Supports saving/loading model weights
- Provides inference for translating new sentences

## Requirements

Install dependencies with:
```
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn keras
```
